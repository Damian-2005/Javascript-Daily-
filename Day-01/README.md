First Son Finder is a mini project that uses the find method to find the name of the first son of the Adebayo Family in an array.

How I built this:

- Wrote array of families represented by objects in this case.
- Then I wrote the function findFamily(fam) -> It takes the parameter "fam" and returns T/F based on whether the family has the "nAme" Adebayo.
- Then I use the find method to get the family with the nAme "Adebayo" and return the name of the son with.
