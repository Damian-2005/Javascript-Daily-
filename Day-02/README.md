Find and filter methods expects their functions to be passed and not called.
i.e you don't add "()" after inserting your written functions, just write the function name.

filter has the same syntax as find but doesn't stop at the first true condition.

filter returns an array of objects too.

I revised arrow functions while I was at it.

Syntax: let functionName = (arguments goes here) => code statements

or

arguements => code statements
